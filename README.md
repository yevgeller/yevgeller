- 👋 Hi, I’m @yevgeller
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, .Net, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, you name it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently reading "Daily Coding Problem", "Concurrency in C#", a DSA book, "Refactoring", "Clean Code." How do you read just one book -- they're all connected!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever
- 📫 How to reach me is yevgeller at gmail
